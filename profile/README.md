# CMU - Database Systems

### Intro to the Course :-

My name is `Mustafa Ahmed` , I am a recent graduate from the Faculty of Science, Cairo University, with a Bachelor's degree in `Computer Science` (Class of 2025). After graduation, I discovered that I am particularly interested in topics related to `DBMS` and `Compilers`. While researching courses on `Database Internals`. I found a YouTube series titled ***CMU - Database Sytems***. It consists of 26 episodes that explain in detail various aspects of database internals, including architecture, algorithms, query processing and execution, and implementation.

The course also includes projects, assignments, and homework, similar to a typical university course. It is taught by ***Dr. Andy Pavlo*** from CMU.
